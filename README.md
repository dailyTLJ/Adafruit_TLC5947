Adafruit_TLC5947
================

  Adapted Adafruit_TLC5947 https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_TLC5947 
  to also work with Hardware SPI

  Comparison (Arduino Due):
  Run 7 boards (168 LEDs) with Software SPI: 13856us ~71Hz
  Run 7 boards (168 LEDs) with Hardware SPI: 561us ~1782Hz

  Library still allows both Sofware and Hardware SPI setup.
